This project is ongoing.

Currently, the page has become somewhat responsive to screen size. I'm currently working on fixing issues related 
to scaling up on a mobile screen so that the content becomes larger. The goal was to have the profile picture, paragragh, and contact links to be side by side on desktop, then flex wrap in the same order. Image top, paragragh middle, contacts on bottom.

I am also working on including an optional dark theme, and navigation. These are on hold until I correct the current issues.
Site will be updated to Github whenever progress has been made.
