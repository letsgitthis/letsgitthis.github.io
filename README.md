This project is ongoing.

I completely rebuilt the entire Portfolio again because I had learned so much from Project 1 that there were very specific things I wanted to include in my Portfolio. It should now be responsive and work on mobile, and include links that display things I've been working on over the last few months.

I am also working on including an optional dark theme, and the menu should navigate you to new pages. If not, the page is not finished so it will loop back to the current page you are on. The Dark Theme works, but I re-wrote a lot of the CSS and need to go back in and correct the drop down.
